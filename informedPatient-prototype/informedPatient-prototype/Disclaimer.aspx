    <h3><u>Drugpedia General Disclaimer</u></h3>
    Drugpedia was part of a summer hackathon project for SoHacks 4. Both developers of the website (Nitesh Kartha and Amadou Bah) are not medical physicians
    and are not seeking a degree/career in the medical field. All "Layman's Descriptions" were made after citing many sources to determine the true meaning 
    of the medical drug interaction description. We are not liable for any consequence of misinterpreting or misusing the information on this webpage. The 
    safest thing to do if you are not sure whether to combine any medications together is to consult your physician.
